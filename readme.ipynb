    "## Overview\n",
    "This project aims to analyze aviation safety data to uncover trends, insights, and actionable recommendations. By leveraging structured datasets, the analysis highlights temporal patterns, geographic hotspots, and causal factors affecting aviation incidents. The findings support proactive decision-making and improved safety measures.\n",

    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "- Aviation Safety Authorities\n",
    "- Airlines and Flight Operators\n",
    "- Policy Makers and Regulators\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Business Questions\n",
    "1. What are the temporal trends in aviation incidents over the years?\n",
    "2. Which regions report the highest number of incidents, and why?\n",
    "3. What are the primary causal factors behind these incidents?\n",
    "4. How can safety protocols be improved based on the findings?\n",

    "## Data Understanding and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source of Data\n",
    "1. **Aviation Data**: Contains details of incidents, including location, date, and cause.\n",
    "2. **US State Codes**: Maps state abbreviations to full names for geographic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description of Data\n",
    "- **Aviation Data**:\n",
    "  - Number of records: 10,000+\n",
    "  - Key Columns: `Date`, `State`, `Cause`, `Fatalities`, `Injuries`\n",
    "  - Missing Data: Addressed using imputation or exclusion based on relevance.\n",
    "- **US State Codes**:\n",
    "  - Used for mapping state abbreviations to full names in visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizations\n",
    "1. **Temporal Trend Analysis**:\n",
    "   - A line graph showing incidents over the years, highlighting peaks and trends.\n",
    "2. **Geographic Heatmap**:\n",
    "   - A heatmap visualizing incidents across US states, identifying hotspots.\n",
    "3. **Cause Distribution**:\n",
    "   - A pie chart summarizing the percentage distribution of key incident causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Conclusions\n",
    "1. **Finding 1**: Incidents peaked during specific years due to systemic or external factors.\n",
    "2. **Finding 2**: Certain states report consistently high numbers of incidents, requiring targeted attention.\n",
    "3. **Finding 3**: The leading causes include human error, mechanical failure, and environmental conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "1. Enhance training programs focused on identified common errors.\n",
    "2. Invest in predictive monitoring and maintenance in high-risk regions.\n",
    "3. Standardize data reporting and collection for better insights.\n",

    "## Commit History\n",
    "### Progression of Updates\n",
    "1. **Initial Setup**: Repository setup with basic folder structure and initial datasets.\n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Multiple commits for cleaning, exploring, and visualizing the data.\n",
    "3. **Final Notebook**: Streamlined code for reproducibility and error-free execution.\n",
    "4. **Presentation Creation**: Added slides and README links.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clear Commit Messages\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- `Initial commit with dataset and requirements`\n",
    "- `Performed EDA: cleaned missing values, visualized trends`\n",
    "- `Added heatmap for geographic analysis`\n",
